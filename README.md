# Credential Reuse0r

**Credential Reuse Check0r** is a fast, multithreaded offensive security tool for testing credential reuse across multiple network services, especially in Windows Active Directory environments.

It allows you to test the same set of credentials against a range of hosts and protocols, such as SMB, LDAP/LDAPS, WinRM, SSH, FTP, MSSQL, and more.  
The tool supports both anonymous and authenticated checks, provides a colored table output, and saves results to a file.

## Features

- **Multi-service credential testing**:
  - SMB (445/TCP)
  - SSH (22/TCP)
  - FTP (21/TCP)
  - LDAP / LDAPS (389 / 636 TCP)
  - LDAP Global Catalog (3268 / 3269 TCP)
  - WinRM HTTP / HTTPS (5985 / 5986 TCP)
  - RDP (3389 TCP, port check only)
  - MSSQL (1433 TCP)
- **Anonymous and authenticated testing**
- **Parallel scanning** (configurable number of threads)
- **Colored table output** for quick visual results
- **Progress bar** to track scan progress
- **Filter results**: choose to display only successful logins or all attempts
- **Results saved** to a file with the username as prefix (e.g. `t.user_cred_reuse_results.txt` or `anon_cred_reuse_results.txt`)
- **Dependency auto-check**: If a required library for a protocol is missing, the tool notes it in the results.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies
  ```bash
pip install tqdm impacket paramiko ldap3 pywinrm pymssql
```
2. Clone this repository:
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminIheukumere/creds_reus0r
cd creds_reus0r.py
chmod +x creds_reus0r
```
## Usage
  ```bash
./creds_reus0r <IP-RANGE>
```

Enter Username & Password for authenticated scan.
Leave Username empty (just press enter) for anonymous scan.

## Examples
Single IP:
  ```bash
./creds_reus0r 10.10.10.10
```
IP-Range:
```bash
./creds_reus0r 10.10.10.0/24
```

## Notes
- Anonymous mode: Works for services that allow null or guest sessions.
- RDP check: Only checks if TCP/3389 is open â€” does not perform authentication.
- WinRM: Requires pywinrm and requests-ntlm for authentication.
- MSSQL: Requires pymssql.

## Output
- Authenticated Scan: Found credentials will be put in #USERNAME#_cred_reuse_results.txt
- Unauthenticated Scan: Found shares will be put in anon_cred_reuse_results.txt

Content of the output file will be printed on screen, when scan is done, too, if shares were found.
